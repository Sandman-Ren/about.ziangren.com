# My Journey in Computer Science: From Curiosity to Career

Reflecting on my path through computer science education, internships, and building a career in tech, sharing lessons learned and advice for aspiring developers.

## The Beginning

My journey into computer science started with a simple question: *"How does this work?"* As a kid, I was always curious about the technology around me, from video games to websites.

## University Years

### Finding My Passion

Computer science wasn't my first choice - I actually started in a different field. But after taking an introductory programming course, I was hooked. There was something magical about writing code and watching it come to life.

### Key Courses That Shaped Me

- **Data Structures & Algorithms** - The foundation of everything
- **Operating Systems** - Understanding how computers really work
- **Database Systems** - Learning to think about data at scale
- **Software Engineering** - Building real projects with teams

## Internship Experiences

### First Internship: The Reality Check

My first internship was eye-opening. The gap between academic knowledge and real-world application was significant. I learned:

- Code reviews are invaluable
- Reading code is as important as writing it
- Communication skills matter more than you think

### Growing Through Each Experience

Each subsequent internship brought new challenges and growth opportunities. I went from feeling like an imposter to becoming a confident contributor.

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Skills

1. **Fundamentals matter** - Fancy frameworks come and go, but understanding the basics serves you forever
2. **Learn to debug** - The best developers are often the best debuggers
3. **Read documentation** - It's a superpower that many overlook

### Soft Skills

1. **Ask questions** - There are no stupid questions, only missed learning opportunities
2. **Document your work** - Future you will thank present you
3. **Build relationships** - Your network is your net worth in tech

## Advice for Aspiring Developers

> "The best time to start was yesterday. The second best time is now."

If you're starting your CS journey:

- **Build projects** - Theory is important, but practice makes perfect
- **Contribute to open source** - It's a great way to learn and give back
- **Find mentors** - Learn from those who've walked the path before
- **Stay curious** - Technology evolves rapidly; embrace lifelong learning

## Looking Forward

The journey continues. There's always more to learn, new challenges to tackle, and exciting technologies to explore. I'm grateful for every step that brought me here and excited for what's ahead.
