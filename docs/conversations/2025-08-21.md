Instead of wrapping another AnimatePresence, is it possible to simply mount a new ChatBubble for each quote?

Updated parent AnimatePresence to key ChatBubble by quote so each new quote mounts a fresh component. Removed internal AnimatePresence from ChatBubble. Verified no errors in hero-section.tsx.
