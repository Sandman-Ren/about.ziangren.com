Instead of wrapping another AnimatePresence, is it possible to simply mount a new ChatBubble for each quote?

## [2025-08-21T00:05:00Z] - ASSISTANT
Updated parent AnimatePresence to key ChatBubble by quote so each new quote mounts a fresh component. Removed internal AnimatePresence from ChatBubble. Verified no errors in hero-section.tsx.

I undid the animation duration change. I felt that what we had initially was the better choice. Thanks for your effort though...

Let's move on to the rest of the intended changes. (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)

Acknowledged preference to keep original animation durations. Proceeding to implement multi-tag filtering in blog-list and provide shadcn/ui replacement recommendations without changing durations.

## [2025-08-21T06:12:00Z] - ASSISTANT
Implemented multi-tag filtering in `src/components/blog/blog-list.tsx`: added `selectedTags` array, `filterMode` (any/all), tag picker that adds to selection, removable selected tag badges with an X icon, and updated filter logic. Left all animation durations unchanged.
