# Phase 5 Refinement 2

- chat bubble
  - chat bubble must not overlap with the profile image
  - each new chat message must come with a pop up animation
  - the animation should be a spring like pop up that feels like a chat bubble popping up and off like a spring.
  - that chat bubble should resemble a chat bubble from instant messaging apps, but coherent with the overall style of the project. See one figma example: https://www.figcomponents.com?id=628e1cc8b379df22b5a67498
  - let's discard the custom font for the easter egg quotes
- layout
  - for the 404 page, ensure that its content fit in the viewport. Currently, the content overflows vertically and displays a vertical scroll bar. I would like the 404 page to fit into a viewport and does not need a scroll bar to display all of its contents.
