# Building My Own Server

This is a series where I share how I set up my own server from scratch using a couple of Windows, MacOS and Raspberry Pi devices that happen to lie around in my room. The goal is to document what I've done and some design decisions I made along the way.

The goal of this journey is to have a single node, self-hosted server that can run public facing applications and secured with HTTPS, authentication and authorization via an Identity Provider (IdP). Hopefully I'll get the chance to deploy Kubernetes (or a light-weight K3S instance on my 4 devices).

## Network Setup

Gateway: 1 2.5Gbps Ethernet Router (1 2.5Gbps WAN, 3 1Gbps LAN)
Switches: 1 8-Port 1Gbps Switch, 1 5-Port 1Gbps Switch

## Services

This section covers the list of services that I deployed on my server.
